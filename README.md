IRDPNet

IRDPNet is an innovative deep learning model designed to enhance the performance of infrared (IR) and depth (RGB-D) image processing tasks. By leveraging the complementary information from both IR and depth modalities, IRDPNet aims to improve accuracy and robustness in various applications, including object detection, scene understanding, and robotics.

🧠 Overview

IRDPNet utilizes a dual-branch architecture that processes IR and depth images simultaneously, extracting features from both modalities. The model then fuses these features to make predictions, effectively combining the strengths of each input type. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where RGB images are unavailable or unreliable, such as in low-light or nighttime conditions.

⚙️ Key Features

Dual-Branch Architecture: Processes IR and depth images in parallel to capture modality-specific features.

Feature Fusion: Combines features from both branches to enhance prediction accuracy.

Robust Performance: Maintains high performance in challenging conditions, including low-light environments.

Modular Design: Easily adaptable for various tasks, including object detection and scene segmentation.
